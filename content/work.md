#### Associate Project Engineer - [UL, LLC](https://www.ul.com/) (Sept. 2019 - Present)

Every day at UL, I strive to advance my understanding of electronic controls.

I carefully evaluate product schematics, trace layouts, mechanical assembly drawings, bills of material and more from the newest technologies of the most recognizable global brands.

My responsibilities include independent and team efforts to:

* Evaluate the functional safety, hardware reliability, and software reliability of electronic controls,
* Identify applicable test programs dictated by [UL standards](https://ulstandards.ul.com/) and other [international standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission#IEC_standards), and implement draft datasheets for those tests,
* Engage in peer review processes with a team of incredible, experienced engineers,
* Interface with customers of all experience levels to determine project scope, timeline, and cost,
* Perform hands-on electrical and mechanical laboratory safety testing and data interpretation (perks!)
